select obl.ownedbooklistid
from bookinfoauthors bia,  authors ,ownedbooklist owl,
where (authors.authorid = bia.authorid)
and (bia.bookid = owl.bookid)

and (
 (authors.authorname = 'something1')
or (authors.authorname = 'something2')
or (authors.authorname = 'something3')
)


Here i will have to check variable number of authors.
Like $AutherName=['something1','something2','something3',...]
